For all the rest, I was better.;yes;yes;yes, team. I did not wand to stop it and wanted to increase productivitz in the sense of reducing overall process time.;speed, spatial position of the building blocks on the board, so that we could work in parallel;a little bit as I experienced that the positioning of the robot was verz precise *(good) but also negativelz as there were two collisions at the wheel placement task;I would probably keep pretty much the same allocation, perhaps I would play around with some variants to improve the process and to reduce the process time

But my opinion on this matter is biased based on prior literature on HRI;nothing specific - i did not pay attention to the robot much. instead, i focused on the layout;i believe i changed the allocation slightly, due to a.) fine tuning the number of actions and how long they take and b.) some things about the task were not that clear and became clearer during the process, so i adapted my strategy;nothing specific, i believe after 4 runs i more or less optimised my strategy

Therefore, I tried to assign task to the robot where I need to do the tasks which the robot cannot perform. Then I had a look at the layout where I need to perform the task to enable work in parallel. And if possible I assigned to to me because I am faster.;I did not really consider this because it was already predefined which task the robot can do which tasks the robot cannot do but for example the assempz of the dovetail i take over because at the first place it was not fully assembled. All the other task are very good performed by the robot.;I would say not but it was good to have his support at the task to work in parallel.;Not always because for example at both round the robot finished already earlier than be which could be more optimized but generally it was a good balance;If the movments are faster then probably yes because this is currently from my perspective which makes him slow.;I would consider us as a team because we worked together on the project and were successfully.;I did not really consider the qualitites of the robot because in the first place I saw the robot is able to do the task good and this supported that I can assign him the available task and do not consider other qualities of the robots.;No, I always saw it the way that the robot and I am a team and we are working together on the project to finish it fast..;I would better manage it that I and the robot finish at the same time because when the robot is doing nothing at the and it does not really reduce the cycle time. And also consider more the layout because at a run I looked at the wrong workplace because the arranged differently where the robot is comming and then I could not work that in parallel as I wished.

It felt alright, like a team work;Sure, I think so.;It felt like a teamworked, while I was busy doing some tasks, he managed to do the rest.;It was more the position of the Bilduing rather than the Robot capacities. The way he moved also influenced wether I should start with a task or another.;No, I think it is useful and could be really nice id in the future could do more things.;Mazbe the position of the Wheel and the Hospital. If you want the  robot to do most of the things but zou also want to be readz with your tasks, then you will probablz start with these 2 task, but because they are to aproximated to each other, it is kind of difficult to work wihtout colliding with the robot.
